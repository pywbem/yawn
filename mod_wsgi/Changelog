* check for output parameters from InvokeMethod call
  - not all parameters may be present according to mof declaration

* consider parameter as input if IN qualifier is missing and
  it is not an output parameter

* fixed parsing of objectpath from input fields, when values contain ':'

* try to guess the type of input property, when inspection fails

* check for presence of "description" strings, which can be missing
  in template rendering

0.1.7 upstream svn revistion: 617
 * bumped version

 * fixed rendering of html-tagged text
 * due to default mako pre-filters, our hs filter did not work

 * Fixed gathering of information for instance properties with qualifiers
 * obtained from class.

 * On ReferenceNames view no longer shall Associator table contain
 * role of referred instance name.
 *  - this was caused by object path comparison taking into account
 *    "host" property - which is not much used

 * Speeded up FilterReferenceNames view.
 *  - GetClass is called only once for each class needed

 * FilteredReferenceNames view now groups up object paths into one
 * table.

 * Associator table now contains additional link for each referent to
 * corresponding instance of association class.

 * fixed enumeration of instances
 * when number of istances was 0, exception was raised

 * fixed checking for scheme, host and port on Login view

 * mentioned yawn.py script in README

 * added changelog file

 * upstream svn revision: 610

0.1.6 upstream svn revision: 609
 * render whole path of reference values

 * all instance name references are now rendered with whole path instead
 * of just class name

 * upstream svn revision: 609

 * fixed most of pylint errors and warnings

 * more consitent naming of variables
 *  - only those used as parameters for views are left in camelCase

 * fixed rendering of filtered_reference_names

 * upstream svn revision: 608

 * added a hint for user, when having connection problem

 * which is caused by selinux settings

 * upstream svn revision: 607

 * bugfixes

 * fixed referring to jason methods from javascript, when application
 * is not based on root url ('/')

 * fixed checking for authentication info from javascript

 * do not print traceback upon authentication error, but ask user instead

 * upstream svn revision: 606

0.1.5 upstream svn revision: 605
 * fixed installation of static files for jqyeru-ui

 * allow to input null,empty or non-empty strings

 * added a checkbox for every not-required, not-key, not-array fields
 * on user input forms
 *  - when checked   -> send nothing for this value
 *         otherwise -> send the contents of input field (may be even
 *            empty string)

 * upstream svn revision: 604

 * clarified name of method on invocation page

 * upstream svn revision: 603

 * correctly handling arrays of values

 * arrays are working for {get,create,modify}_instance

 * allow specification of particular reference key values, instead of
 * specifying whole object path as compressed string
 *  - using async request for instance querying and key properties
 *    informations acquisition
 *  - added dependency on jquery-ui (licensed under MIT) for dialog window,
 *    that allows to select matching instance
 *  - query for matching instance is composed from non-empty filled keys

 * moved view decorators for Yawn methods to views module

 * added test directory

 * upstream svn revision: 602

 * partitioned __init__.py module into submodules

 * new modules:
 *     cim_insight - functions for obtaining defails about cim objects
 *     inputparse  - functions for parsing user input (from html forms)
 *     render      - functions for conversion of data to string
 *     util        - miscellaneous utilities

 * changed the way to render templates
 *  - using a new context manager render.Render
 *  - this is needed for nicer pywbem error outputing

 * pywbem errors no longer looks like yawn errors
 *  - instead error description is rendered on particular template in place
 *    of output data

 * upstream svn revision: 601

 * nice rendering of return value

 * invoke method page shows returned value with qualifiers and renders
 * clickable path, when reference is returned

 * upstream svn revision: 600

 * correctly rendering array of values

 * correctly rendering data type "array of reference"

 * upstream svn revision: 599

 * fixed displaying of reference in instance names

 * wrong class name was used when displaying references of instance names

 * upstream svn revision: 598

0.1.4 upstream svn revision: 597
 * fixed rendering of None on invoke method page

 * Caption was set to None on page with results from method invocation.
 * This resulted in None as caption text.

 * upstream svn revision: 596

 * fixed rendering of reference output value

 * Previously rendering of results from CIM method invocation failed,
 * when one of the output parameters was reference or instance of object.

 * upstream svn revision: 595

 * fixed classifying method parameters as IN/OUT

 * All method parameters were classified as input.
 * also output parameters were not classified properly.

 * upstream svn revision: 594

 * fixed ignoring namespace field on login form

 * namespace field on login form was ignored
 * now if given, EnumClassNames is rendered for it directly

 * upstream svn revision: 593

 * removed obsoleted "Powered by mod_python" logo

 * upstream svn revision: 592

 * fixed rendering of refd values of CIMInstanceName

 * Refered object values were rendered as not-clickable strings for
 * object paths. Now they are clickable - they lead to corresponding
 * GetInstance pages.

 * upstream svn revision: 591

 * fixed rendering of instance's REF value

 * previously a className of rendered instance was rendered
 * in value field in instance table

 * this is now fixed to render a className of referred instance

 * upstream svn revision: 590

 * printing of CIMDateTime value made nicer

 * upstream svn revision: 589

 * fixed not showing invoke method button

 * invoke method button did not show up for methods with no input
 * parameters

0.1.3 upstream svn revision: 588
 * fixed parsing of form with serialized object

 * upstream svn revision: 587

 * fixed delete instance page rendering

 * upstream svn revision: 586

 * fixed modify_instance page rendering

 * upstream svn revision: 585

 * fixed not working modify instance method

 * upstream svn revision: 584

 * added link 'create instance' to class page

 * since some providers does not support instance names enumeration, but
 * creation of instances is possible, we need to have available reference
 * to that page

 * upstream svn revision: 583

 * log not handled form parameters

 * upstream svn revision: 582

 * allow to set keys for new instances

 * upstream svn revision: 581

 * focus newly created input

 * upstream svn revision: 580

 * enlarged input field of query

 * upstream svn revision: 579

 * fixed installation of static files and templates
 * fixed wsgi script to handle static files under apache

 * upstream svn revision: 578

0.1.2 upstream svn revision: 577
 * rewritten to use mako templates

 * templates are stored as files under pywbem_yawn/templates directory
 * and accessed view pkg_resources functions
 *  - this means, that they are part of package (or egg)
 *  - but can be stored separately (for example under /usr/share/...) and
 *    it's path can be given as parameter to script
 * the same goes for static data (css, javascript)
 * all styling code moved to standalone css files
 * added dependency to jquery for some client-side form magic

 * minimized code duplication
 *  - removed url, ns, request params from every view method
 * added thread safety with werkzeug's local storage
 *  - wsgi allows to handle request concurrently
 * values of array data types now displayed in form as multiple input
 *   fields equipped with javascript for easy appending/removing them
 * doctype changed to xhtml 1.1
 * all rendered pages should now pass validation
 * removed two mofcomp methods (I coudn't find out, what they were used for and
 *   there was no reference to them from any page)
 * moved todos to TODO file

 * upstream svn revision: 576

 * fixed authorization
 *  - by adding directive to apache's configuration telling
 *    it to pass auth headers to the script

 * upstream svn revision: 575

 * original code moved to mod_python
 *  - mod_python is being deprecated, so more love should go to mod_wsgi

 * added new code for Apache's mod_wsgi

 * upstream svn revision: 574
