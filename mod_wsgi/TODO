show associators object paths on ReferenceNames results
make clear, what method is invoked on invoke_method_prep page
 and show method description
on user input error, return to dialog page with errors highlighted

examine possible sfcb bugs:
 - boolean key property does not get sent in reply from broker, when
   it's a value of reference, that is a value of returned reference:
     OP with keys:
      - OP with keys:
        - boolean property;
        - ...
      - ...

make some tests
python 3 support

from original yawn:
  - Beautify the error screens
  - Fix various code that is not case insensitive
  - Display property/method/parameter names from the class instead of the
    instance, as they will be more likely to be pretty (mixed-case), whereas
    providers sometimes will have all lowercase property names that don't
    look as good.
  - Mark properties on instances that aren't in the schema (it's been known
    to happen).
