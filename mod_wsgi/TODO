from original yawn:
  - Beautify the error screens
  - Fix various code that is not case insensitive
  - Display property/method/parameter names from the class instead of the
    instance, as they will be more likely to be pretty (mixed-case), whereas
    providers sometimes will have all lowercase property names that don't
    look as good.
  - Mark properties on instances that aren't in the schema (it's been known
    to happen).
