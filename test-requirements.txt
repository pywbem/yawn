# Pip requirements file for development.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Unit test direct dependencies (e.g. imports into testcases):

# pytest
# pytest 4.3.1 solves an issue on Python 3 with minimum package levels
# pytest 6.0.0 causes pylint to report "not-callable" issues
pytest>=4.3.1,!=6.0.0; python_version == '3.6'
pytest>=4.4.0,!=6.0.0; python_version >= '3.7'


# Install test direct dependencies:

# virtualenv
virtualenv>=20.0.0


# Indirect dependencies with special constraints:

# packaging (used by pytest)
packaging>=17.0

# pluggy (used by pytest)
pluggy>=0.13.0

# six (used by virtualenv, tox, probably others)
# virtualenv 20.0 requires six>=1.12.0 on py>=3.8
# tox 3.17 requires six>=1.14.0
six>=1.14.0


# Additional indirect dependencies are not specified in this file:

# appdirs
# attrs
# distlib
# filelock
# more-itertools
# py
# pyparsing
# six
# wcwidth
